# FEEDBACK.md - Xano MCP/XanoScript Feedback

## [2025-02-19 18:35 PST] - Successful First-Attempt Validation

**What I was trying to do:** Create a GCD/LCM exercise following the required architecture

**What the issue was:** No issues encountered! The code passed validation on the first attempt.

**Why it was an issue:** N/A - This is positive feedback that the documentation is working well.

**Potential solution (if known):** The xanoscript_docs tool provided clear enough documentation that I was able to write valid XanoScript code on the first try. Key factors that helped:
- Clear examples of function structure with input/stack/response blocks
- Explicit mention of `while` loops needing to be inside `stack` blocks
- Clear type names (int, text, bool instead of integer, string, boolean)
- Examples showing the Euclidean algorithm pattern with modulo operator
