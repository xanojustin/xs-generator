# CHANGES.md - Code Evolution Between Validations

## Validation 1 - Initial

**Files validated:** 
- `/Users/justinalbrecht/xs/reverse-bits/run.xs`
- `/Users/justinalbrecht/xs/reverse-bits/function/reverse_bits.xs`

**Result:** PASS ✓

Both files passed validation on the first attempt. No changes were required.

**Code at this point:** 
- `run.xs`: Simple run job calling the reverse_bits function with input 43261596
- `function/reverse_bits.xs`: Function that reverses bits of a 32-bit integer using 
  a while loop with 32 iterations, building the result bit by bit
