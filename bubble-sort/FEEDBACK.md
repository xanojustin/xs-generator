# FEEDBACK.md - Xano MCP/XanoScript Feedback

## [2025-02-18 22:30 PST] - Successful Implementation

**What I was trying to do:** Create a bubble sort algorithm in XanoScript as a coding exercise

**What the issue was:** No issues encountered - the implementation validated successfully on the first attempt

**Why it was an issue:** N/A - This was a successful validation

**What worked well:**
- The `xanoscript_docs` tool provided clear examples for function structure
- The quick reference mode was concise and contained all the syntax patterns needed
- The validation tool gave a clear "✓ function.xs: Valid" response
- The error types reference and quick filter reference were helpful
- The existing examples in `~/xs/` provided a clear template for structure

**Suggestions for improvement:**
- The documentation could benefit from more array manipulation examples (like `set` filter used for swapping)
- More examples of nested loops would be helpful for algorithmic exercises

## [2025-02-18 22:30 PST] - Documentation Clarity

**What I was trying to do:** Understand how to swap elements in an array

**What the issue was:** Had to infer the `set` filter usage for array element replacement based on general filter patterns

**Why it was an issue:** While I found the correct syntax (`$arr|set:$i:$value`), a specific example of array element manipulation would have saved time

**Potential solution (if known):** Add an example in the quickstart or syntax docs showing array element assignment/modification
