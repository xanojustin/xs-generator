# FEEDBACK.md - Xano MCP/XanoScript Feedback

## [2025-02-21 12:05 PM PST] - No Issues Encountered

**What I was trying to do:** Create a Valid Palindrome coding exercise with a run job and function using XanoScript.

**What the issue was:** No issues encountered. Both files validated successfully on the first attempt.

**Why it was (not) an issue:** The XanoScript documentation provided by `xanoscript_docs` was clear and sufficient to write correct code on the first try.

**What worked well:**
1. The `run` topic documentation clearly showed the `run.job` syntax with the `main` property
2. The `functions` topic documentation clearly showed the function structure with `input`, `stack`, and `response`
3. The `syntax` topic provided clear examples of filters like `to_lower`, `split`, `reverse`, and `join`
4. The regex filter `regex_replace` was documented and worked as expected

**Potential improvements:** None at this time - the documentation and validation worked as expected.
