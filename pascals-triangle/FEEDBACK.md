# FEEDBACK.md - Xano MCP/XanoScript Feedback

## [2026-02-20 03:32 PST] - Successful Exercise Completion

**What I was trying to do:** Create a Pascal's Triangle coding exercise using XanoScript

**What happened:** The exercise was completed successfully with all files passing validation on the first attempt.

**Key observations:**

1. **Documentation was clear and helpful:** The `xanoscript_docs` tool provided sufficient examples to understand:
   - Function structure with `input`, `stack`, and `response` blocks
   - Run job syntax with `main.name` and `main.input`
   - Control flow (while loops, conditionals, foreach)
   - Variable declaration and updates

2. **MCP validation worked flawlessly:** The `validate_xanoscript` tool correctly validated both files with no errors.

3. **Pattern from existing exercises was consistent:** Previous implementations (fibonacci, fizzbuzz) provided clear templates to follow.

**Positive feedback:**
- The quick_reference mode for documentation was concise and useful
- Having existing examples in the repo made it easy to follow conventions
- Validation errors (when they occurred in past exercises) were helpful in pinpointing issues

**No issues encountered on this exercise.**
