# FEEDBACK.md - Xano MCP/XanoScript Feedback

## [2026-02-19 06:02 PST] - Validation passed on first attempt

**What I was trying to do:** Validate the Pascal's Triangle implementation

**What the issue was:** None - validation passed on first attempt!

**Why this is notable:** After examining several existing implementations (fibonacci, bubble-sort, etc.), the function structure and syntax patterns were clear enough to write valid code without iterative fixes. The existing exercises serve as excellent reference material.

**Observation:** The validation tool works well and provides clear pass/fail feedback. No issues encountered with this exercise.
