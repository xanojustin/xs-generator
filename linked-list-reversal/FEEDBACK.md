# FEEDBACK.md - Xano MCP/XanoScript Feedback

## [2025-02-19 04:30 PST] - No Issues Encountered

**What I was trying to do:** Create a linked list reversal exercise implementing the classic iterative three-pointer algorithm

**What the issue was:** No issues encountered - the code validated successfully on the first attempt

**Why it was an issue:** N/A - no blocking issues

**Potential solution (if known):** N/A

## Notes

The linked list reversal exercise was straightforward to implement using:
- `json` type for the linked list nodes (allows flexible object structure)
- `var` declarations for the three pointers (prev, current, next)
- `while` loop for iteration through the list
- `get` filter to safely access object properties with null defaults
- Object literal syntax to create reversed nodes

The XanoScript syntax was clear and the validation tool provided quick feedback.
