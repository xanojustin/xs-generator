# FEEDBACK.md - Xano MCP/XanoScript Feedback

## [2026-02-20 14:05 PST] - No Issues Encountered

**What I was trying to do:** Create a meeting rooms exercise with a run job and function

**What the issue was:** None - both files passed validation on first attempt

**Why it was an issue:** N/A

**Potential solution (if known):** N/A

---

**General observation:** The XanoScript pattern for run jobs and functions is straightforward once you understand the structure. Having existing exercises to reference (like fizzbuzz and bubble-sort) made it much easier to write correct code on the first try.
