# FEEDBACK.md - Xano MCP/XanoScript Feedback

## 2025-02-19 03:35 PST - Successful First-Pass Validation

**What I was trying to do:** Create a "Move Zeroes" coding exercise with a function that moves all zeros to the end of an array while preserving order of non-zero elements.

**What the issue was:** No issues encountered! The code passed validation on the first attempt.

**Why it was an issue:** N/A - Everything worked smoothly.

**Positive feedback:** The MCP validation tool worked correctly and provided clear confirmation that the code was valid. The documentation from `xanoscript_docs` was comprehensive and helped write correct code.

**Notes for future exercises:**
- The two-pointer algorithm translated well to XanoScript
- Array operations using `get` and `set` filters work as expected
- The `while` loop syntax is straightforward
- Using `var.update` to modify variables in loops is the correct pattern
