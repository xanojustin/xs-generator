# FEEDBACK.md - Xano MCP/XanoScript Feedback

## 2025-02-19 20:35 PST - Successful First Try

**What I was trying to do:** Create a rotate-array exercise with run.job calling a function

**What the issue was:** No issues - both files passed validation on first attempt

**Why it was (not) an issue:** The documentation from `xanoscript_docs` was clear and comprehensive. The examples in quickstart and functions topics provided sufficient guidance.

**Potential solution (if known):** N/A - No issues encountered

## 2025-02-19 20:35 PST - Documentation Quality

**What I was trying to do:** Understand XanoScript syntax for array operations

**What worked well:**
- The `quickstart` topic provided clear patterns for common operations
- The `functions` topic explained the function structure well
- The `run` topic clearly showed how to use run.job with main and input

**Specific helpful patterns used:**
- Using `slice` filter to extract portions of arrays
- Using `merge` filter to combine arrays
- Early return with `return { value = ... }` for edge cases
- Modulo operator for normalizing rotation steps
- `count` filter to get array length

**Suggestion:** The documentation is comprehensive and well-organized by topic. The quick reference tables for type names (text vs string, int vs integer) were especially helpful for avoiding common mistakes.
