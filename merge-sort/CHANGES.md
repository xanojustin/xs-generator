# CHANGES.md - Code Evolution Between Validations

## Validation 1 - Initial

**Files validated:** function.xs
**Result:** Pass
**Code at this point:** Initial implementation of merge sort algorithm

- Implemented iterative bottom-up merge sort
- Uses width doubling approach: starts with subarrays of size 1, then 2, 4, 8, etc.
- Merges adjacent sorted subarrays in each pass
- Handles empty and single-element arrays as base cases
- All syntax and structure validated successfully on first attempt
