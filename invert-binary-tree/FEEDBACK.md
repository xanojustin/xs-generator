# FEEDBACK.md - Xano MCP/XanoScript Feedback

## [2026-02-20 21:05 PST] - No Issues Encountered

**What I was trying to do:** Create an invert-binary-tree exercise with a run job and function

**What the issue was:** No issues encountered - both files passed validation on the first try

**Why it was an issue:** N/A - successful implementation

**Potential solution (if known):** The documentation was clear and sufficient for this exercise

## General Feedback

### Documentation Quality
The XanoScript documentation obtained via `xanoscript_docs` was comprehensive and well-organized. The quickstart guide covered common patterns and mistakes effectively.

### MCP Tool Performance
The `validate_xanoscript` tool worked correctly and provided clear output showing which files passed/failed.

### What Worked Well
1. The recursive function pattern was straightforward to implement
2. The `json` type for the tree input allowed flexible nested object handling
3. The `get` filter with default values (`$obj|get:"key":null`) was useful for safely accessing nested properties
4. The `return` statement for early exit in base cases worked as expected

### Suggestions for Improvement
None for this exercise - the implementation was smooth.
