# FEEDBACK.md - Xano MCP/XanoScript Feedback

## [2026-02-20 05:35 PST] - No Issues Encountered

**What I was trying to do:** Create an LRU Cache coding exercise with a run job and function

**What the issue was:** No issues encountered - both files passed validation on the first try

**Why it was an issue:** N/A - Everything worked as expected

**Potential solution (if known):** The documentation from `xanoscript_docs` was clear and comprehensive enough to write correct code on the first attempt. The examples for `run.job` structure and `function` syntax were particularly helpful.

## General Feedback

**Positive notes:**
1. The `xanoscript_docs` tool with topic parameters worked well for retrieving specific documentation
2. The validation tool caught no errors, indicating good documentation clarity
3. The separation between `quickstart`, `functions`, and `run` topics made it easy to find relevant patterns

**Documentation clarity:**
- The `run.job` syntax with `main = { name: "...", input: { ... } }` was well documented
- The function structure with `input { }`, `stack { }`, and `response = $var` was clear
- Examples in the docs closely matched the patterns needed for this exercise
