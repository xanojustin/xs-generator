# CHANGES.md - Code Evolution Between Validations

## Validation 1 - Initial

**Files validated:** 
- `run.xs`
- `function/is_happy_number.xs`

**Result:** ✅ PASS — All files valid

**Code at this point:** This was the initial implementation. No changes were needed after validation.

The happy number function was implemented with:
- Proper input block with int parameter
- Stack block using cycle detection with a seen array
- While loops for both the main cycle detection and digit processing
- Conditional blocks for edge cases and final result determination
- Response set to a boolean variable
